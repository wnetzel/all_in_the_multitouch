# It's All In The Multitouch
 A repository for my thesis in the Master's program "Music, Communication and Technology" at the University of Oslo.

 ## Code
 Contains "Soothsayer-6", my Pure data instrument inspired by the [Sequential Prophet-6](https://www.sequential.com/product/prophet-6/) synthesizer.

 Dependencies:
 - [Pure Data (0.54-1)](https://puredata.info/)
 - [Else (1.0-0 RC-10)](https://github.com/porres/pd-else/) library for Pure Data
 - [pd_mpe](https://github.com/DanielRudrich/pd_mpe) Pure Data external for MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE)

The synthesizer contains a modified version of a Pure data abstraction for parsing MPE data found in the pd_mpe external by DanielRudrich.

 ## Thesis
 The thesis will be added at a later stage.
